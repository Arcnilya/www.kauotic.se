Do you want to get into Capture The Flag cybersecurity challenges?
We know that getting started can be confusing and scary, so we have
spent some time working on a beginner friendly **hacker skill-tree**!

The idea is that we help you by compiling guides, tutorials, platforms,
videos, and much more for you. We have also developed some challenges just
for YOU! When you have solved 3 of our challenges in a category you can head
to one of our CTF events and get a cool sticker!

We have stickers for three different categories: 
[Web](web), 
[Rev/Pwn](rev-pwn), and 
[Crypto](crypto).
The idea is that you should feel more prepared and confident when playing
CTFs with us. The stickers are not a requirement for joining though.

Click one of the categories to start your hacker journey!
