The KAUotic Hackerspace is located at Karlstad University in room [21C404](https://link.mazemap.com/VX831C3K).
The room code means: building 21, corridor C, floor 4 (and then room 04).

This is the location where we have most of our activities in the club, but it is also a
social hub for computer science students when no events are active.

The machines and furniture in the room are sponsored by the Mathematics and Computer Science department
at KAU. If you think that something is missing, feel free to let us know in the Discord and we might make
it a reality!
