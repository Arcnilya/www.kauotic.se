CTF stands for Capture The Flag and is a gamified way of learning cybersecurity. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity))

This is a group of people in the club creating CTF hacking challenges, from beginner to advanced. The goal is to create fun and engaging puzzles and challenges which helps people understand cybersecurity ideas and problems.

They are maintaining and developing the CTFd platform at [ctf.kauotic.se](https://ctf.kauotic.se). Feel free to register an account, capture a couple of flags and climb the leaderboard.
