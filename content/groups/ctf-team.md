CTF stands for Capture The Flag and is a gamified way of learning cybersecurity. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity))

This is a group of people in the club playing CTF hacking games hosted by various organizations. The two main goals are to gain knowledge and improve cooperation in the team, while getting high positions on leaderboards is a nice bonus.

Previous competitions have been hosted by HackTheBox (HTB), Totalförsvarets forskningsinstitut (FOI), Försvarets Radioanstalt (FRA), Militära underrättelse- och säkerhetstjänsten (MUST) and Säkerhetspolisen (SÄPO).
