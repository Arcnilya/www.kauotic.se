This group in the club schedules and organizes lectures and presentations.

Anyone is welcome to present something, even topics not directly linked to hacking and security. In the past we have had presentations about: linux command line, git basics, wargame playthrough, Tor introduction, hacking MIDI-controllers, hacking Mifare-cards and penetration-testing of mobile apps.

Other notable presentations in the past include people from Telia and Google talking about company resilience and incident response.
