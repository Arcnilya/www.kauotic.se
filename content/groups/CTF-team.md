Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are a popular way for hackers and security enthusiasts to test and improve their skills. They are typically organized as a series of challenges that are designed to test a participant's knowledge and ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a simulated environment.

The Capture The Flag Team group is responsible for representing KAUotic Hacking Club when participating in CTF competitions. They work together to practice and develop their skills in preparation for the competition. Additionally, they also evaluate the results of the competition, as well as preparing reports and reviewing the challenges and areas they can improve on. They may also research on new CTF techniques and strategies to improve the team's performance in future CTFs.

Previously attended competitions have been hosted by HackTheBox [(HTB)](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/), Totalförsvarets forskningsinstitut [(FOI)](https://foi.se/forskning/informationssakerhet/crate---sveriges-nationella-cyberanlaggning-for-totalforsvaret/crate-ctf---en-tavling-i-cybersakerhet.html), DownUnderCTF [(DUCTF)](https://downunderctf.com/) as well as Försvarets Radioanstalt (FRA), Militära underrättelse- och säkerhetstjänsten (MUST) and Säkerhetspolisen (SÄPO) in [Undutmaning](https://undutmaning.se/).
