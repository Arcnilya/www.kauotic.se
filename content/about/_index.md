Welcome to KAUotic Hacking Club!

We are a community of people interested in computers, hacking, privacy, and
security. Our goal is to create a community that attracts individuals with a
passion for technology and cybersecurity, and provides them with opportunities
to learn, share and improve their skills.

The best way to defend or repair a system is first knowing how it can break.
The best way to break a system is knowing how it works. With this in mind, we
focus on obtaining and sharing knowledge, as we believe that this is the
foundation of building a strong and capable community.

We have a long tradition of playing Capture The Flag hacking competitions (CTFs).
If you are curious about a gamified way to learn cybersecurity, you have come
to the right place! We also organize workshops where you can get some hands-on
experience with hardware gadgets and software tools. We invite speakers from
industry and academia to talk about cybersecurity. We also have a physical
HQ at KAU, the KAUotic Hackerspace! This is like a second livingroom where
you can meet like-minded people and work on projects. It is also where we
play CTFs.

Check out our [Events](/events) page to see a list of our past activities. If
you have a suggestion for an event, please don't hesitate to contact us. We
would love to hear from you!

Welcome to KAUotic Hacking Club, we are excited to have you! :D
