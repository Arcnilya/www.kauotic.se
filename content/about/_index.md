The goal of the KAUotic Hacking Club is to create a community that attracts people 
interested in computers, hacking, privacy and security. 
The best way to defend or repair a system is first knowing how it can break. 
The best way to break a system is knowing how it works. 
We therefore focus on obtaining and sharing knowledge.


We love computer science, security and being around people that share this interest, wanting to teach and learn.


We believe that this hacking club creates a community that will drive interest in computer science and security beyond the standard university curriculum.


We are committed to building a platform that attracts people interested in computer security and computers in general, organizing events, and supporting specialized interest groups.
