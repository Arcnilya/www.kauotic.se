"How do you sabotage an uranium enrichment facility without wreaking nuclear havoc? Use malware! In this cybersecurity campfire talk I will tell the tale of Stuxnet, a malware that started a whole new era in cyberwarfare. As always, there will be free marshmallows and time to discuss after the talk." - Meiko
